# This reusable workflow verifies that the software quality meets certain standards.
# It also produces build artefacts that can be published at a later stage.
#
# It is triggered by other workflows as needed.
# It is also triggered by pushing commits to the `main` branch to prepare the workflow cache for future pull requests.
# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows#restrictions-for-accessing-a-cache
#
# It can be triggered manually on any branch via the GitHub CLI:
#
#   gh workflow run integrity.yml [--ref <branch-name>]
#   gh run watch
#
# It can also be triggered manually on any branch via the GitHub web interface:
