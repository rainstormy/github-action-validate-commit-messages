# This workflow implements one of the final stages of the release pipeline.
# It creates a draft GitHub release from a full semantic version tag in Git.
#
# It is triggered by pushing a Git tag on the form `v<major.minor.patch[-prerelease][+buildinfo]>` as done by `.github/workflows/publish-tags.yml`.
#
# It can be triggered manually via the GitHub CLI:
#
#   gh workflow run publish-github.yml --ref <tag-name>
#   gh run watch
#
# It can also be triggered manually via the GitHub web interface:
# https://github.com/rainstormy/github-action-validate-commit-messages/actions/workflows/publish-github.yml
